# Juan Charles - the Discord fantasy name generator bot.

Juan Charles is a Discord bot used to generate names for characters in fantasy settings. 

# Usage
Tell the bot what race and gender you want, as well as the number of names you want generated, to a maximum of 20 names at a time.

By default, the bot replies to `@` commands or messages prefixed with `%`, or in direct messages with no prefix. `%help` should provide all the help you need.
